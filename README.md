*All the code written here pretty much covers all the concepts of C++ and object oriented paradigm*
* Make sure you scrutinise the comments. That's where you'll be learning the most and reading them would also prohibit you from pulling your hair in conundrum of not comprehending the code.
* A problem can be solved in multiple ways. The code doesn't show you the only correct solution, but just one solution.
